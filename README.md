The Ladders 4th Cohort impossible quiz final project

## Using Git
To pull the code:
```
  git pull
```

To add local changes:
```
  git add .
```
Then commit those changes:
```
  git commit
```
(To enter a message in vim press 'i' then type your message then hit 'esc' then ':wq')
Once you have committed your code then:
```
  git push
```
(If it gives you an error try getting the latest from git hub `git pull` first and try again)
